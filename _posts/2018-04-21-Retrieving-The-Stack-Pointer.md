<b>Abstract</b>
There are times when you need to take a closer look at the address space of your Arduino development board. 
Small sketches may or may not render memory problems depending on the Arduino board you've got, but a fairly complex project can 
easily chew through the SRAM available and multiple allocations and deallocations using `malloc()` and `free()` may result in 
memory issues because the available free chunks may not be big enough to hold what you're about to allocate.

In situations like these, it's recommended to keep an eye to the memory, the way data is positioned, and how you can optimize it.

### A matter of memory
As you probably know, Arduino boards, especially the `AVR` ones, don't come with an awful lot of memory. They're intended for relatively 
small projects (or very well optimized ones - that's the beauty of working that close to the hardware). To better illustrate the 
memory problems that can occur, I've composed the following table containing the built-in SRAM, EEPROM, Flash and the architecture of
the most common Arduino boards.
